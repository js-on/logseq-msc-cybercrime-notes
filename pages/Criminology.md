- Tell me basics of modern criminology with special focus on cyber crime.
	- Modern #criminology has focused on crime in terms of its social and cultural context, as well as its history, causes, consequences, and patterns. It also incorporates theories from #psychology, #sociology, #economics and #biology to explain criminal behaviour. Special attention has been paid to the major types of crime and the juvenile justice system, as well as the prevention of crime.
	  
	  #Cybercrime is a growing issue due to the increased use of technology. It refers to any illegal activity that involves computers or the Internet. Types of cybercrime include [[online fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[hacking]], [[cyberstalking]], [[cyberbullying]] and distributing [[child pornography]]. To combat this increasing crime, new strategies are being developed for both the investigation and prevention of cybercrime. These include improved communications between law enforcement, private industry and consumers and the development of a secure internet infrastructure.
