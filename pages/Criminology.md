- Modern #criminology has focused on crime in terms of its social and cultural context, as well as its history, causes, consequences, and patterns. It also incorporates theories from #psychology, #sociology, #economics and #biology to explain criminal behaviour. Special attention has been paid to the major types of crime and the juvenile justice system, as well as the prevention of crime.
  
  #Cybercrime is a growing issue due to the increased use of technology. It refers to any illegal activity that involves computers or the Internet. Types of cybercrime include [[online fraud]], [[identity theft]], [[hacking]], [[cyberstalking]], [[cyberbullying]] and distributing [[child pornography]]. To combat this increasing crime, new strategies are being developed for both the investigation and prevention of cybercrime. These include improved communications between law enforcement, private industry and consumers and the development of a secure internet infrastructure.
- ### Criminological Theories

	- There are many theories in criminology. Some attribute crime to the individual; they believe that an individual weights the pros and cons and makes a conscious choice whether or not to commit a crime. Others believe it is the community's responsibility to ensure that their citizens do not commit crime by offering them a safe and secure place in which to live. Some ascertain that some individuals have latent traits hat will determine how they will react when put in certain negative conditions. By studying these theories and applying them to individuals, perhaps psychologists can deter criminals from repeating crimes and help in their rehabilitation.
	- The **Conflict Theory** in Criminology is a theoretical perspective of crime that posits that crime is the result of socio-economic power struggles between marginalized people and those in positions of influence. This understanding of crime sees crime as a directly linked to inequality in society, as those with the power to commit crime are the same people who are the most advantaged economically. It suggests that the laws, regulations, and institutions in society, depending on their design and implementation, can either benefit or harm individuals who are marginalized.

	- **Choice Theory** in Criminology is a theory which proposes that people commit crimes because they believe that the benefits of doing so outweigh the costs. This theory suggests that individuals use cost/benefit analysis to make decisions and are motivated to act in accordance with self-interest. Choice theorists argue that criminal behavior should be understood in terms of the choices made by individuals regarding their behavior. This theory suggests that the decision-making process and motivation for criminal behavior is based on an individual's perception of rewards and punishments, as well as an assessment of the risks involved. It also suggests that people make these decisions in order to gain pleasure, reduce pain, and increase their sense of control or power.
	- The **Classical Theory** in Criminology is a school of thought that believes criminal behavior is a result of a rational choice made by individuals after weighing the potential costs and benefits of a particular act. The theory proposes that people are rational beings and that if the cost of criminal behavior outweighs the potential rewards associated with the act, then criminal behavior will not be chosen. It follows that the deterrent of punishment is necessary for society to live in harmony and in order to adequately protect its citizens. According to the theory, crime can be prevented or reduced by making punishments appropriate and relevant to the severity of the crime as well as cost-effective and swift in nature.
	- The **Critical Theory** in Criminology is a theory of crime that focuses on the way in which power operates to create and maintain social inequality. It suggests that power can be used by individuals to control resources and manipulate others to gain favour, benefits and advantages over their peers. The Critical Theory in Criminology argues that the power dynamics between different social classes and groups enable certain members to benefit from criminal activity, while others suffer without any option for recourse. It is critical of traditional criminal justice systems and seeks to challenge the existing power structures to promote a more just and equal society.
	- The **Labeling Theory** in Criminology postulates that when people are labeled as engaging in criminal activities, they are more likely to challenge social norms and engage in further criminal activities. This theory of criminal behavior is based on the idea that once someone is labeled as a criminal they are no longer viewed as being capable of rehabilitation and are instead viewed as delinquents. As such, they become more likely to engage in criminal activities as a means of showing their disregard for social norms and regulations.
	- The **Life Course Theory** in Criminology is a theoretical framework used to understand the development of criminal behavior over the life course of an individual. It posits that criminal behavior is the result of a combination of biological and environmental factors working together to influence the development of the individual's behavior during different stages of his or her life. This theory proposes that criminal behavior is a multidimensional and dynamic process that involves the interaction of individual, family, and community influences. Within this framework, activities and events in a person's life may cause them to become more or less likely to engage in criminal activity.
	- The **Positivist Theory** in criminology is a school of thought that suggests that the root cause of criminal behavior is based on elements outside of individual control, such as biological and environmental factors. It is in contrast to the classical school of thought, which holds that criminal behavior is a conscious choice made by an individual with free will. Positivist Criminology focuses on the physiological and psychological factors that affect criminal behavior and proposes that a scientific approach is the best way to examine crime and criminality. This theory has been applied to understand factors like criminal personality, biological predisposition, social class, and poverty.
	- The **Rational Choice Theory** in Criminology is a theory which states that criminal behavior is a product of logical decisions thought to maximize individual benefit in a given situation. Proponents of the theory believe that individuals consider the gains and risks before committing a crime, and that those that are more likely to gain from their chosen action are the ones that choose to commit a criminal act. This means that punishment, cost of criminal activity, and availability of opportunities to commit crimes all affect an individual’s decision to commit a crime. According to the theory, crime is rational and calculable, and at its core, a choice.
	- The **Routine Activity Theory** in criminology is an integrative theory that explains why crime happens. This theory proposes that crime happens when a motivated offender, a suitable target, and a lack of suitable guardianship converge at the same time and in the same place. This means that crime is more likely to occur when motivated offenders have access to attractive targets without much regard for the presence of formal or informal guardians. This theory is used to explain both individual and collective forms of crime.
	- The **Social Control Theory** in criminology looks at why some individuals break the law while others don’t. This theory suggests that people's behavior is guided by social forces, such as family, friends, and community. By strengthening and reinforcing certain behaviors, these forces can control or guide people away from criminal activities. Supporters of the theory believe that if individuals lack the necessary social bonds, they are more likely to commit crimes. Positive external forces such as family and school engagements can help individuals learn the importance of discipline and self-control, while negative external forces such as those that lead to poverty, unemployment, and injustice can lead to criminal behavior.
	- The **Social Disorganization Theory** in Criminology is a theory of crime and deviant behavior that suggests that structural and cultural factors in the environment are the primary causes of crime. Specifically, the theory states that social environments with poverty, high population density, people living on the margins of society, and a lack of access to necessary resources lead to a lack of informal social control, which contributes to an increase in crime. The theory has been used to explain and predict crime at the neighborhood level, and has been utilized in programs aimed at reducing crime.
	- The **Social Learning Theory** in Criminology is a theory developed by Canadian criminologist Albert Bandura which states that people learn from observing and imitating others. This theory suggests that criminal behavior is learned through imitation and reinforcement of what is observed around them. This theory has been used to explain the development of aggression, delinquency, and other criminal-related behaviors. It is believed that the behavior of 'role models' can have a significant influence on an individual's own behavior, both positive and negative.
	- The **Strain Theory** in Criminology is a sociological perspective that states that people will resort to criminal behavior when they experience a gap between their goals and the means they have available to achieve those goals. This gap is known as "strain," and it is thought to disrupt an individual's social balance and lead to feelings of frustration, helplessness, and anger. This can lead to a depletion of moral resources, rendering an individual more likely to engage in criminal activity to reward themselves or regain their sense of control.
	- The **Trait Theory** in Criminology is an approach used to explain individual behaviors and criminal acts. This theory is based on the idea that individuals are born with certain biological and psychological traits or characteristics, which determine how they will respond to situations. These traits, which may be positive or negative, can influence a person's decision-making process, and therefore may increase the likelihood of criminal activity. The Trait Theory is widely used in criminology and forensic psychology to identify and classify offenders, as well as to understand and predict criminal behavior. This theory suggests that criminal behavior is determined by the interplay between an individual's biological and psychological traits and their external environment.
