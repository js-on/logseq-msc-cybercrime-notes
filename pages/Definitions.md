  > This is a social engineering attack that takes advantage of the amount 
  of trust that users give to websites they regularly visit, such as 
  interactive chat forums and exchange boards. Users on these websites are
   more likely to act in abnormally careless manners. Even the most 
  careful people, who avoid clicking links in emails, will not hesitate to
   click on links provided on these types of website. These websites are 
  referred to as watering holes because hackers trap their victims there 
  just as predators wait to catch their prey at watering holes. Here, 
  hackers exploit any vulnerabilities on the website, attack them, take 
  charge, and then inject code that infects visitors with malware or that 
  leads clicks to malicious pages.

  > This is also related to a normal phishing attack, but it does not send 
  out high volumes of emails in a random manner. Spear phishing is 
  specifically targeted to obtain information from particular end users in
   an organization. Spear phishing is more strenuous since it requires the
   attackers to perform a number of background checks on targets in order 
  to identify a victim that they can pursue. Attackers will then carefully
   craft an email that addresses something of interest to the target, 
  coercing him or her to open it.

  identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

  > Characterising cyberspace using a model with four layers. It is not the computer that creates the phenomenon we call cyberspace. It is the interconnection that makes cyberspace - an interconnection that affects all the layers in our model. From the top down, the important layers are:
	- The people who participate in the cyber-experience - who communicate, work with information, make decisions and carry out plans, and who themselves transform the nature of cyberspace by working with its component services and capabilities.
	- The information that is stored, transmitted, and transformed in cyberspace.

	- It is sometimes difficult to achieve a good balance between the CIA triad of information. Therefore, ISM can be considered as the *art and science* of achieving an effective balance.

	- ICT is an umbrella term for the tools, infrastructures, applications and services used for the transmission of information. It includes a wide range of technologies, from basic telephone and fax services to complex networks, from simple word processing to sophisticated multimedia software, from simple data communications to sophisticated Internet applications.
