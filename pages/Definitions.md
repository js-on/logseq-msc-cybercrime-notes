	- > This is a social engineering attack that takes advantage of the amount 
	  of trust that users give to websites they regularly visit, such as 
	  interactive chat forums and exchange boards. Users on these websites are
	   more likely to act in abnormally careless manners. Even the most 
	  careful people, who avoid clicking links in emails, will not hesitate to
	   click on links provided on these types of website. These websites are 
	  referred to as watering holes because hackers trap their victims there 
	  just as predators wait to catch their prey at watering holes. Here, 
	  hackers exploit any vulnerabilities on the website, attack them, take 
	  charge, and then inject code that infects visitors with malware or that 
	  leads clicks to malicious pages.
