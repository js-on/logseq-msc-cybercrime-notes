- ### Lecture: Security Policy Components
	- > The development of a security policy is a cornerstone in ISM
	- Based on risk analysis, a security policy determines the critical assets that need to be protected, and includes procedures and control measures to prevent and respond to security incidents and breaches.
	- ISO/IEC 27002 stipulates that the objective of SP is to provide management direction and support for IS in agreement with business requirements and relevant laws and regulations.
	- **Components of SP**
	  According to ISO/IEC 27002, an organisational SP needs to include at least the following:
		- **Access Control**: Access rules and rights to sensitive information should be exhaustively defined and documented taking into account business requirements for access. A control system against unauthorised access should be put in place to manage user privileges, networked services and operating system access. It is also important to implement a monitoring system to detect early signs of anomalies or abuse of privileges.
		- **Definition and allocation of responsibilities**: The security policy must clearly specify roles and responsibilities for information management across the organisation. Personnel in charge of ISM develop, implement and maintain security controls. their responsibility and authority areas should be clearly stated and documented.
		- **Information security awareness, education, and training**: Managers and technical personnel misbehaviour, due to social engineering, human errors, abuse of privileges and trust, could cause unexpected damages. therefore, it should be necessary to ensure that all work system users understand and follow security rules and to enhance employees' security consciousness by means of education and training.
	- For example, all users should be made aware of the procedures for reporting security incidents, and should be required to report such incidents as quickly as possible. Additionally, users should be informed regularly on the updates of the security policy including security requirements, legal responsibilities and business controls in order to prevent or limit potential security risks.
