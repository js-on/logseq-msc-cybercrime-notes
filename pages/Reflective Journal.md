- **What is Reflective Learning?**
  Welcome to the first of many reflective sections: a place for you to pause, think about what you are learning, and what it means to you.
	- Ramsey (2006) describes reflection as going through a deliberate process of cycles of enquiry, balancing what you do with thinking about how it went and what you might do next. You can reflect upon many things, including events, situations, relationships.
	- A key point is to reflect before too much time has passed between the experience and your reaction to it. There are many cyclic models of learning, of which Kolb (1984) is perhaps the best known.
	- Even a »micro-reflection«, such as writing a Tweet about what you are learning, can help you to organise your thoughts and remember key points later.
- **Reflective Journal**
  You will explore the weekly statement in recurring assessments. To help prepare for your assessed artefacts, write up to 250 words in your Reflective Journal ([[ePortfolio]]).
	- Consider the weekly statement and note down your initial thoughts.
	- Ensure you apply what you have learned in this week's lecture, forums, readings and independent research into your notes.
	- Every week we will revisit the weekly statement and, over time, develop and prepare a body of work to support both assessment artefacts.
